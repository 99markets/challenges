# Ninety Nine Data Analysis Challenge

## **Description**

Congratulations! As the new member of theÂ **Ninety Nine Data** team, our Business, Marketing and Product departments trust in you to provide the data needed to extract the correct insights about our users and the product, that will be used to set the company's strategy and prioritize projects accordingly.

The objective for this quarter is to analyze cryptocurrencies as a potential addition to the app catalogue. To obtain the raw data, you will be able to use Coincap, an open data API that provides lots of info about crypto: https://docs.coincap.io/

## **Requirements**

- Create a dashboard in Tableu displaying the top 30 cryptos by market cap in USD. Include for each crypto:
   1) Name
   2) Last price in USD
   3) Last price in EUR
   4) Average daily price in Q1 2021 in USD
   5) Include filters that can be used by the Dashboard user by market cap and by name.

## **Deliverables**

- Code used to read from the API and generate the CSV files. Please add a README file with instructions about how to run it.
- All files required to visualize the data in Tableau: project file and CSVs where it reads from.

We hope you have fun! We appreciate your time completing this exercise.
