# Ninety Nine Wordpress Challenge

## **Description**

Congratulations! As the new member of the **Ninety Nine Marketing** team, you are trusted with the implementation and maintenance of the company's website that will show to the world how amazing the Ninety Nine Apps are.

The objective for this exercise is to create a simple Wordpress plugin that enriches a page with financial information of cryptocurrencies.

## **Requirements**

- Create a Wordpress plugin that scans a web page and adds real time price for every occurrence of the symbols of Bitcoin or Ethereum. There are a lot of cryptos but for this exercise we will only focus on those two.
- Example: if a page contains the text "Today the price of BTC went up and the price of ETH went down" will be changed to "Today the price of BTC (6929.82$) went up and the price of ETH (404.97$) went down"
- Limit decimals to 2 digits.
- To obtain the prices, you will be able to use Coincap, an open data API that provides lots of info about crypto: https://docs.coincap.io/

## **Deliverables**

- Zip file with the code of the plugin

We hope you have fun! We appreciate your time completing this exercise.
