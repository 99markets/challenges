# Ninety Nine Wordpress Challenge

## **Description**

Congratulations! As the new member of the **Ninety Nine Marketing** team, you are trusted with the implementation and maintenance of the company's website that will show to the world how amazing the Ninety Nine Apps are.

There are two objectives for this exercise:

1) Create a simple Wordpress plugin that enriches a page with financial information of cryptocurrencies.
2) Perform a small assessment of performance of www.ninetynine.com

## **Requirements for the Wordpress plugin**

- Create a Wordpress plugin that scans a web page and adds real time price for every occurrence of the symbols of Bitcoin or Ethereum. There are a lot of cryptos but for this exercise we will only focus on those two
- Example: if a page contains the text "Today the price of BTC went up and the price of ETH went down" will be changed to "Today the price of BTC (6929.82$) went up and the price of ETH (404.97$) went down"
- Limit decimals to 2 digits
- To obtain the prices, you will be able to use Coincap, an open data API that provides lots of info about crypto: https://docs.coincap.io/

## **Requirements for the performance assessment**

- Run a performance check on www.ninetynine.com in the way you prefer (either manually or using any performance tool) and provide at least 5 things to improve regarding performance, core Web vitals or security
- Keep in mind the website is built using Wordpress and Elementor

## **Deliverables**

- Zip file or Github repo with the code of the plugin
- Description in email or shared Google doc with the performance assessment

We hope you have fun! We appreciate your time completing this exercise.
