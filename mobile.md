# Ninety Nine Mobile Challenge

## Description

Congratulations! As the new member of the **Ninety Nine** iOS/Android team, you are in charge of implementing one of the new screens that will drive millions of users into our *fintech* app. This time our Product team wants our users to be able to visualize currency exchanges over time.

Your task is to build a simple flow of at least two screens where the user will select two currencies and two dates, and will be presented with a graph with how the exchange of the selected currencies changed over the selected time.

- To acquire the data, we encourage the usage of https://api.exchangeratesapi.io
- To build the graph, we encourage the usage of the Charts library (https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts)

## Requirements

- The exercise must be done in **Swift** for *iOS* positions and **Kotlin** for *Android* positions
- Feel free to use any library, tool or pattern you usually use
- Extra kudos if you use **Rx** (we use it extensively)

## The code should:

- Be written as production-ready code
- *"Be clean, my friend"*
- Have detailed notes attached, explaining the solution, why certain things are included and why others are left out

We hope you have fun and we appreciate your time completing this exercise.
