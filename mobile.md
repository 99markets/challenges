# Ninety Nine Mobile Challenge

## Description

As **Ninety Nine** is a *fintech* company we want to create a mobile application that lists some details about the most important companies of the world.

The mobile application should show that list of companies ordered by *share* price (which value come within each company detail).
Every time the user taps on a company name, the application should show a detailed company page/view. As each company *share* price changes almost in real time, the company detail views should be refreshed at least every 20 secs in order to show the current real *share* price.

To support this challenge, we have created two endpoints to get the necessary information:
- GET Companies: https://dev.ninetynine.com/testapi/1/companies
- GET Company by ID: https://dev.ninetynine.com/testapi/1/companies/{companyId}

## Requirements

- Prepare your project for Android or iOS. It depends on the job position.
- If your application is for the *Android* position, the project must be done using **Kotlin**.
- If your application is for the *iOS* position, the project must be done using **Swift**.
- Feel free to use any library, tool or pattern you usually use.

## The code should:

- Be written as production-ready code.
- *"Be clean, my friend"*.
- Think on code scalability and maintainability.
- Have detailed notes attached, explaining the solution, why certain things are included and why others are left out.

Last but not least, have fun and take your time to do it.
