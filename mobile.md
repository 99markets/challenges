# Ninety Nine Mobile Challenge

## Description

As **Ninety Nine** is a *fintech* company we want to create a mobile application that lists some of the most important companies of the world.

The mobile application must shown a list of companies order by its share price. Every time the user taps on a company, the application must shown the company detail. As the company share price changes so fast the company detail screen must refresh to show the current share price every 20 seconds.

To support this challenge, we have created two endpoints to get the necessary information:
- GET Companies: https://dev.ninetynine.com/testapi/1/companies
- GET Company by ID: https://dev.ninetynine.com/testapi/1/companies/{companyId}

## Requirements

- Prepare your project for Android or iOS. It depends on the job position.
- If your application is for the *Android* position, the project must be done using **Kotlin**.
- If your application is for the *iOS* position, the project must be done using **Swift**.
- Feel free to use any library, tool or pattern you usually use.

## The code should:

- Be written as production-ready code.
- *"Be clean, my friend"*.
- Be easy to grow and easy to maintain.
- Have notes attached, explaining the solution and why certain things are included and others are left out.

Last but not least, have fun and take your time to do it.
